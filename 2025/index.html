    <h1>ICLC 2025</h1>

    <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>The International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) is dedicated to practices and research focused on technologies and philosophies that interpret the use of computer code and the public writing of algorithms as performative gestures. In its previous editions the community has provided valuable insights on this practice from diverse perspectives, including technical, philosophical, educational and political.  </p>

    <p>In the ten years since the first edition of the conference in 2015, we have collectively and collaboratively experimented with varying levels of live coding abstraction, developed domain-specific languages, and explored the levels of agency offered by models created manually, or sometimes with the assistance of learning algorithms. We have invented and played with numerous interfaces to interact with algorithms and the world around us during performances. These explorations revolve around defining what processes we actually want to showcase, and in which formats we want to express them, while ‚Äúthinking algorithmically‚Äù with an audience. Ten years after the first ICLC, we encourage our community to leverage its multidisciplinary strengths and discover new boundaries to expand, or to dissolve.  </p>

    <h2>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</h2>

    <p>The ninth edition of ICLC will take place in Barcelona, Spain, from May 28 to May 30, 2025. We invite submissions in the form of papers, live performances, workshops, satellite events, etc. The call will soon be open to anyone engaged with live coding and its community principles. See the information about important dates below, and watch this space for more detailed info to come.   </p>

    <p>We know you will have lots of questions for us, but please take into consideration that we are still ramping up operations and have work to do before publishing templates, the submission platform, and the full call details. These details will be published soon, so no need to email us with these questions! üôÇ </p>
