In 2004 gnd became a member of Bratislava&#x27;s first media lab Burundi, and after its demise co-founded the Itchy Bit collective, focused on happenings on the intersection of art, social issues and technology. Apart from performing solo, gnd is also a member of Kolektiv - a loose improvisational / live-coding body of creators of algorithmic music and visuals based in Prague. His visuals are usually live-coded in environments such as Pure Data, his own glslr, or pijockey on Raspberry PI. Besides his visual work, gnd holds a MA from theatre direction at the DAMU Theatre Academy in Prague.
