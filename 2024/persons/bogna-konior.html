			`<p>Bogna Konior is an Assistant Professor of IMA (Interactive Media Arts) and co-director of the Center for AI and Culture at NYU Shanghai. She is also a Research Fellow in the Antikythera Program on Speculative Computation at the Berggruen Institute, and a mentor in the Synthetic Intelligence program at Medialab-Matadero Madrid. She is the author of The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet (Flugschriften, 2019), and. together with Anna Greenspan and Benjamin Bratton, the editor of Machine Decision is not Final: China, and the History and Future of AI (Urbanomic, 2024). Her work on digital culture, philosophy of new media, and posthumanism has been presented internationally, recently including the Cambridge Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, ZKM | Center for Art and Media, e-flux, and the Ljubljana Biennale. She is currently working on two projects concerned with long-term trajectories of technological development. Her current academic project is on Polish science fiction writer and philosopher, Stanislaw Lem, and his neglected contribution to the theory of biotechnological evolution of autonomous reason. She is also conducting a multimedia research project on female Catholic mysticism as an early form of cybefeminism and a predictor of machine erotics, nonhuman personhood, and artificial reproduction. @bognamk </p>`);
