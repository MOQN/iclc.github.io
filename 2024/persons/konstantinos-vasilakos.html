			`<p>Konstantinos Vasilakos is an interdisciplinary artist working in the millieu of interactive media and Sonic Arts. His research interests run the gamut from sonification to new instruments for musical expression and live-coding with networked music systems. Some of his projects are Dark Matter, a live coding project with particle collision data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, in Switzerland. Among other things, he is the author of IPSOS, a web-based novel interface for real-time sonification of high-energy physics data from the LHC. It was commissioned by art@CMS, CERN and the University of Birmingham. It is used as an educational workshop for students and physics teachers as well as for the interested layman. He is also the author of numerous tailor-made software solutions for multidisciplinary work involving real-time sound reinforcement for body movement and dance, machine learning and neural networks for sound installations.</p>`);
