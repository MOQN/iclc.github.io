			`<p>DJ_Dave is an experimental electronic-pop artist, DJ, and producer, synonymous with the art of live coded music — music made and performed using computer code. Appreciated by coders and electronic music appreciators alike, DJ_Dave first appeared on the scene in 2021 when she began combining live coding and DJ mixing at underground New York City raves. She has since been performing her state-of-the-art live process on festival stages, dance floors, and classrooms around the world, and releasing uniquely visceral tracks also created through a live-coded process. Notably, DJ_Dave has performed at The Whitney Museum, Grimes’ MET Gala Afterparty, Coachella, and GitHub Universe, she has released remixes by artists including Tove Lo, Channel Tres, and Uffie, she has toured with JPEGMafia and Hannah Diamond, and she just finished a year-long DJ residency on Frank Ocean’s Homer Radio. As a proponent for coding in the club, DJ_Dave continues to reexamines electronic musical temporality and find ways to connect live coding to the masses.</p>`);
