Ivan Abreu		CENTRO University	As an artist and computer programmer, I investigate forms of art generated with algorithmic processes and inserted into digital everyday life.  My work takes multiple forms such as installations, graphics, sound art, interactive digital media and audiovisual concerts. My beginnings as a typographer and visual communicator influence my artistic production, which is why my production processes dilute the border between design and art.  I am interested in proposing to the observer and listener new ways of relating to visuality, sound and space..
