					<p id="overview">The International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) is dedicated to practices and research
						focused on technologies and philosophies that interpret the use of computer code as gesture within the
						context of live performances. In its previous editions the community has offered important insights on this
						practice from many diverse perspectives – technical, philosophical, educational, political, and more.</p>
					<p>ICLC 2024 takes place in <b>Shanghai, China</b> from <b>May 30 to June 1 2024</b>, and
						we wish to challenge our community to bridge even further to its multidisciplinary strengths. We are pleased
						to invite submissions of proposed contributions in the form of theoretical works, live and live-recorded
						audio/visual performances, workshops, and satellite events. This call is open to everyone. We encourage
						submissions that cover any topic related to live coding, but in particular we invite contributions that
						consider the following themes:</p>

					<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Positive Longitudes</h3>
					<p>This will be the first time that ICLC will take place in Asia and we are looking forward to connecting live
						coding communities in the larger Asian region as well as those in Australia and New Zealand. We aim to
						highlight the diverse practitioners and communities found throughout the locale and to forge new connections
						between Asia+ and the rest of the world.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Conversational Improvisations</h3>
					<p>The rapid rise of LLMs and other Generative AI tools over the past years has had a large impact on creative
						practices. We welcome submissions that investigate how such tools are creatively used within the context of
						live coding. Questions regarding what new modes of performance LLMs and Generative AIs enable and where the
						agency lies in such a human-machine conversation are of particular interest.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Crafting Code</h3>
					<p>The act of writing code is a craft that is remarkably broad in its approaches, executions, and
						implementations. Different practices have varying affordances allowing for multitudes of outcomes. The
						expressive and improvisational possibilities present in the crafting of code are an interplay between the
						coder(s), the language, and the environment. At a time when AI tools are promising to abstract away some of
						its minutiae: we’re also interested in further exploration of the nuances of coding practices, and the
						cultural significance of code being inscribed, read and enacted.</p>

					</p>
					<p>There are no submission fees.</p>

					<p>Submissions are expected to be done in English. For the Live Performance category, you are welcome to
						submit the proposal in your own language and add a machine-translated version.</p>

					<h4 class="mt-5" id="format-paper">Long and short papers</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Short paper: 2-4 pages</li>
						<li>Long paper: 5-12 pages</li>
						<li>Condensed Outline: max 100 - 150 words</li>
						<li>Short biography: max 150 words for each contributor</li>
					</ul>

					<p>All papers must be written in academic format using the provided template, including appropriate citations
						as well as the application of suitable research methods.</p>

					<p>Preference will be given to paper submissions that can be presented in-person at the conference. However,
						if the authors have a pressing reason for not being able to attend in-person, remote paper presentations
						will be considered.</p>

					<h4 class="mt-5" id="format-performance">Live Performances</h4>

					<p>Live Performances (including audio, visual, and A/V or multimedia) will largely be sorted into one of two
						formats: a concert format, with seated audience; and an Algorave format, unseated and intended for dancing.
					</p>

					<p>Please support your submission with a clear description of your performance and discussion of influences
						and prior art as appropriate. Provide a link (Vimeo, Youtube, Soundcloud) to illustrate the performance.
						Please also be as thorough as possible with the Technical Requirements so that we can avoid surprises.</p>

					<p>To acknowledge that not everyone will be able to travel to China for ICLC 2024, we invite open submissions
						from the community as an alternative way to participate.</p>

					<p>All relevant Open Submissions will be published in the proceedings.</p>

					<h4 class="mt-5" id="format-satellite-event">ICLC Satellite Events</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Format: Declaration of interest</li>
						<li>Submit via email to <a href="mailt:shanghai.iclc24@nyu.edu">shanghai.iclc24@nyu.edu</a> until February
							15, 2024</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We invite live coding nodes from all over the world to host their own satellite events prior to or after
						ICLC 2024. The goal is to give communities for which participation in China might be more difficult to
						achieve an opportunity to still contribute to the conference. While the committee of the ICLC cannot
						directly help with funding or organization of your event, an effort will be made to coordinate dates and
						locations.</p>

					<p>Please submit your intent to participate with your own event, providing us with a principal contact to your
						group/organization, the city where the event will take place and any information that might already be
						definitive (set date, set venue, line-up...). Additionally we invite you to join the channel
						#iclc-satellite-events on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/D4Enr5u7Rp">TOPLAP Discord server</a> to
						present and discuss your ideas for a satellite event in order to connect organizers as early as possible to
						make the most out of it.</p>

					<p>We ask you to investigate possibilities to apply for local funding to help cover for accommodations, travel
						costs and in the best case artist fees. We can provide you with a Letter of Intent to support applications
						for funding and will publish the date and url of your event on the ICLC website.</p>

					<hr class="mt-5" />
					<h2 class="mb-4" id="fees-funding">Fees &amp; Funding Information</h2>

					<p>There are no fees to submit a proposal for peer review.</p>

					<p>Participants are encouraged to seek outside funding. The committee can provide participants with Letters of
						Invitation/Intent to apply for support through local internationalization grants or the embassies that
						support cultural exchange.</p>

					<p>Please follow ICLC 2024 updates for more details to come about registration fees and travel assistance.</p>
